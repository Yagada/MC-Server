# Options affecting the basic behavior of iDisguise (including the developer API)
disguise:
   
   # Do disguised players see their own disguise in 3rd person view.
   # This only works for player disguises at the moment.
   # WARNING: DON'T ENABLE THIS FEATURE IF YOU USE BUNGEECORD, it will crash Minecraft clients.
   view-self: false
   
   # Do disguised players keep their disguise when they leave the server
   keep-disguise-leave: true
   
   # Do disguised players keep their disguise when you shutdown the server
   keep-disguise-shutdown: true
   
   # Modify disguised players' death messages
   # e.g. 'RobinGrether tried to swim in lava' -> 'Notch tried to swim in lava' in case RobinGrether is disguised as a player called Notch
   modify-message-death: false
   
   # Modify disguised players' join message
   # e.g. 'RobinGrether joined the game' -> 'Dinnerbone joined the game' in case RobinGrether is disguise as a player called Dinnerbone
   modify-message-join: false
   
   # Modify disguised players' kill message
   # e.g. 'Notch was slain by RobinGrether' -> 'Notch was slain by Zombie' in case RobinGrether is disguised as a zombie

   # Modify disguised players' player list entry
   # If this is enabled disguised players are NOT shown in the player list except if they are disguised as other players,
   # in this case the disguise name is shown instead of the original player name.
   # Consider enabling modify-scoreboard-packets as well if you experience problems with scoreboard/nametag plugins.
   modify-player-list-entry: false
   
   # Modify scoreboard packets
   # This may help scoreboard plugins to work properly with disguised players.
   # Furthermore, this option enables compatibility with NametagEdit and ColoredTags.

   # Show name tags with their original name for disguised players
   # Obviously, this option does NOT affect player disguises.

   # Do disguised players sound like actual mobs
   # e.g. a player disguised as a cow moos when he is hurt

# Options affecting the commands and permissions of iDisguise (these do NOT affect the developer API)

   check: true
   
   # Automatically download new updates (however a server restart is required for an update to take effect)
