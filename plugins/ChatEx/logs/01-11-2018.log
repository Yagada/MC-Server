[00:10:18] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): so the world tree (and its 9 worlds
[00:10:32] Yagada (uuid: c45e7627-1047-41f4-9a17-5589c18e2377): do it
[00:10:33] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): fuck if I know what the actual worlds are though
[00:10:39] Yagada (uuid: c45e7627-1047-41f4-9a17-5589c18e2377): lmgtfy
[00:10:47] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): I put some placeholder lines for the tree branch portals btw
[00:10:57] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): I know Asgard and Earth I think are in those
[00:12:03] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): Also, I think Spawn, at least the bottom part, is pretty close to done
[00:12:10] Yagada (uuid: c45e7627-1047-41f4-9a17-5589c18e2377): looks like it
[00:12:12] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): granted I wanna add a cave under for the 9th portal
[00:12:29] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): where that gray wool is is the entrance I'm thinking
[00:13:00] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): i'm happy with the donor/vote building
[00:13:08] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): The roof turned out great imo
[00:13:21] Yagada (uuid: c45e7627-1047-41f4-9a17-5589c18e2377): yea thats dope

[00:13:40] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): and i'm gonna keep that way
[00:14:21] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): yeah maybe I'll make the shop portal, if that becomes its portal, a building related thing
[00:14:35] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): like make it look like a recently built structure
[00:14:44] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): fit with the buildings around it
[00:15:09] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): what the point of all the portals is atm though, fuck if I know
[00:15:28] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): I'd love to connect them to worthwhile stuff or builds though
[00:15:42] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): apart from the obvious ones like shops, donor stuff or wild
[00:15:47] Yagada (uuid: c45e7627-1047-41f4-9a17-5589c18e2377): yea thatd be dope
[00:16:10] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): we got 3 portals atm though, if you want to hook them up to anything
[00:16:18] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): Forest, snow and fire
[00:16:37] Yagada (uuid: c45e7627-1047-41f4-9a17-5589c18e2377): thatll be somethin later
[00:16:46] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): makes sense
[00:17:59] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): anyways, I should get to bed now
[00:18:05] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): there's your update on the spawn though
[00:18:14] zpm346 (uuid: b9211eb6-a8d7-4bfa-85f5-eb121aba0a2b): probably won't be on again til friday though
[00:18:19] Yagada (uuid: c45e7627-1047-41f4-9a17-5589c18e2377): for sure
